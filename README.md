### About
An application for creating/taking quizzes written in HTML/CSS/JavaScript and the jQuery library.

### Tools used

### Goals for this project

1. Obtain better understanding of JavaScript and related libraries (jQuery)
2. Practice solving some common issues of a web application.
3. Learn new tools and principles of using JavaScript.
4. Think about new design principles and becoming familiar with JavaScript interactions.

### Process

The idea for this project was to create a quiz taking application where users could create a free response styled quiz. The user would be allowed to input questions/answers and then take the quiz they just built.

### Lessons learned

1. How to structure a web application with HTML.
2. How to make a web application more aesthetically pleasing and have the design complement the use of the app.
3. Using jQuery to make a dynamic web page by interacting with user input.
4. Event delegation of the DOM tree
5. Handling callback functions
6. Using filters on jQuery objects
7. Targeting specific elements in the DOM tree

### Extensions for the future

1. Use HTML5's Local Storage Object to store user created quizzes.
2. Attach the quizzes to a database to be accessed from any computer.
3. Allow the user to select different types or styles of quizzes (multiple choice, yes/no, matching, fill in the blank, etc.).
4. Update the design of the page for a cleaner, more professional look with fonts, layering, animations.
